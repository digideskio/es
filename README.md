## Credits

Thanks a lot for the great folks working hard on
[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) and
[Google Go](http://golang.org/).

Also a big thanks to [Blake Mizerany](https://github.com/bmizerany) 
and the [fast heroku client](https://github.com/bmizerany/hk)
for inspiration on how to create a Go-based command line tool.
